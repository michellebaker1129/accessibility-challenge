# Refactoring Challenge

## Horiseon needs help! 

Horiseon, a marketing agency, wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engines. 

Great news! I've been learning about refactoring websites for better accessibility, and I made a few updates to the code which I hope they like.

I updated so many things
* When I viewed the source code, I found most HTML elements were generic. I updated these to follow semantic conventions.
* When I viewed the structure of the HTML elements, I found that logical structure was hard to follow without seeing the styling and positioning, so I grouped elements logically and used ARIA attributes.
* When I veiwed the image elements, I did not find accessible alt attributes, so I added some crisp descriptions of the images. 
* When I viewed the heading attributes, I realized they did not fall in sequential order. This was an easy fix, I just changed the h2 in the footer to h4 in the .html and .css files.
* When I viewed the title element, I found that I needed to update the text to a consise, more descriptive title. 
 
I learned that there are even more ways to make websites more accessible! I was able to address a few extra concerns that horiseon didn't even realise could help. 
* I updated contrast ratio between the text and the background by in teh sidebar section. 
* Where there were icons I used aria-hidden='true' so that web readers would not get bogged down. 
* I applied my aria learinings to attribute the most important HTML elements, which will enhance the screen reader's understanding of the HTML structure.
* I discovered that a line height of at least 1.6 is easiest for sighted viewers, and so is a bit more space around each letter, so I fixed these right up.
* It can be hard to know which elements are links for some viewers, so I added underline styling to the navigation links. 
* Some fonts are easier on the eyes for sighted readers, so I changed teh font family to "Ariel, Helvetica, san-serif" which was recomended by most websites I referenced.

Technology used
* HTML
* CSS
* GitHub
